                    <p>If it is pristine white sand beaches you are looking for, come to the Philippines. Mountains or seas, the Philippines have all the wonders of nature in one great vacation spot!</p>

<p>Luzon, the largest island, stretches from the Ilocos province in the north to Sorsogon in the south. It is in Luzon that you will discover the splendor of the Cordillera rice terraces, century-old rice fields fashioned by the Igorots, Ifugao and Kalinga from sides of the mountains. Today it remains one of the most beautiful sceneries in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Framing the coastline of Puerto Princesa City is Honda Bay. The clear waters permits snorkeling and the enclaves afford one to island hop.</p>

<p>Baler and Infanta in Quezon and Daet in Camarines Norte offer more exciting experiences for surfers seeking the extreme with the bigger waves.</p>

<p>In the Visayas, the largest central groups of islands between Luzon and Mindanao, have islands each distinct and interesting.</p>
